          <p class="quote">
              The minimum wage is going up in New York, and a new sick leave law is also coming into effect for 2021.
              New York is one of 15 states with a paid sick leave law, and workers can use sick leave to recover from an illness themselves, care for a sick family member, or seek help for themselves or a family member for domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking or human trafficking.
              About 1.3 million New Yorkers didn't have access to paid sick leave before the law, according to Gov. Andrew Cuomo's office, and nearly 1 in 4 workers have reported being fired or threatened with termination for taking sick time.
